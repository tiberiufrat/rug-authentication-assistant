This Chrome extension allows you to generate 2FA authentication codes directly in your browser.

It can also automatically insert the generated 2FA code while logging in to the University of Groningen's online portal, Brightspace, so that you don't have to enter them yourself.

This extension is exclusively for the use of RUG staff and students!
